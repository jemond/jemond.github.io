    <h1>Hi! I'm Justin Emond</h1>

    <p>
      I lead a team of amazing people that build beautiful digital things at <a href="http://www.thirdandgrove.com/" title="A digital agency in Boston and San Francisco">Third and Grove</a>. You can learn more about me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinemond/">LinkedIn</a>. I also
      <a href="http://goo.gl/zT8HH" title="Pro Web Project Management">wrote a book</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in hard work, taking pride in what you do, and trying to be less shitty at your job every day. I love eating food, drinking craft beer, playing video games, and reading books.
    </p>

    <h2 title="Why bother reading if you can't talk about how much you read?">I love reading</h2>

    <p>Here is everything I have read since 2017:</p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</em>, by Patrick Lencioni.</strong> A quick business fable style book about the importance of team work for organizations looking to execute. Good, pragmatic stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>A Vital Question</em>, by Nick Lane.</strong> A fascinating theory on the evolutionary force that created complex cellular life from simple bacterial cells, with consequences for animals like us. Great read. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Megamistakes: Forecasting and the Myth of Rapid Technological Change</em> by Steven Schnaars.</strong> I delightful, quick out-of-print read about how bad we people are predicting technology trends. Written almost 30 years ago but so very relevant to the chatter about jobs going away today. Convinced me that my years long belief that most American jobs were on the verge of disappearing was complete folly. I suspect jobs in 2040 will look just like today.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>How to Lie with Statistics</em> by Darrell Huff.</strong> A classic published in 1954. Hilarious and insightful about how easy it is to manipulate insights from data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Predators' Ball: The Inside Story of Drexel Burnham and the Rise of the Junk Bond Raiders</em> by Connie Bruck.</strong> I will read just about anything about the Wall Street excess in the 1980s, and this book does not disappoint. Really great inside account of what started the leveraged buyout era we still live in.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Bonanza Kings: John Mackay and the Battle Over the Greatest Fortune in the American West</em> by Gregory Crouch.</strong> A terrific account of the people that made money from the Comstock Lode. Focuses on John Mackay, the richest American you've never heard of.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Lessons of History</em> by Will Durant.</strong> Super fast read written by a Pulizer Prize winning duo behind massive history tomes (that I have not read). It's sort of their summary of lessons learned from writing about all of human history.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work</em> by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson.</strong> Another interesting and fast read from these guys, but, like all of their books and writing I fear that much of their advice is not realistic as it is based on their unique position (which they don't even seem to understand is so unique): Owning a recurring revenue business with absolutely outrageous margins. I'm convinced if they ever published a profit and loss statement most people would write off all of their advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>A Bright Shining Lie</em> by Neil Sheehan.</strong> An absolutely extraordinary account of the Vietnam War. The breadth and yet personal depth of this book is an achievement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Fiasco: The American Military Adventure</em> by Thomas E. Ricks.</strong> A sad and compelling analysis of the US war in Iraq. The profound folly of the second Bush administration is hard to debate after reading this one. Many parallels with the Vietnam War, so reading this one right before <em>A Bright Shining Lie</em> was useful. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World</em> by Mark Miodownik.</strong> This reads like a love letter by an autistic person to materials science. Great science read.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Who Is Michael Ovitz?</em> by Michael Ovitz.</strong> I personally think Ovitz is one of the most extraordinary entrepreneurs of the 20th century and I don't think he gets his due. His memoir is terrific.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger</em> by Marc Levinson.</strong> I love a big idea book, that takes a unique view on a big issue. Fun read.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power</em> by Daniel Yergin.</strong> A comprehensive history of petroleum from the beginning of the industry to the time of publication (1990). Another book that changed my strong opinion that "oil was evil" to a much more (I hope) nuanced and accurate one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</em> by Siddhartha Mukherjee.</strong> A beautiful and sad book about cancer. What struck me is even after a century of medical research we still don't really understand the fundamental chemistry and biology of how cancer works.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Swerve: How the World Became Modern</em>, by Stephen Greenblatt</strong>. This is one of my all time favorite books. Incredibly well-written and well-argued theory as to what got us into and out of the dark ages, straight into our own Declaration of Independence. Good to read with <em>How The Scots Invented the Modern World and Everything In It</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Consciousness Instinct: Unraveling the Mystery of How the Brain Makes the Mind</em>, by Michael Gazzaniga</strong>. A great science read on how the latest theories of how a brain works and creates that extraordinary consciousness experience we all enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Army of None</em>, by Paul Scharre</strong>. I skipped the back third of this book, which I almost never do. Some interesting ideas around automation, but, if what he writes is accurate I have grave concerns that our military leadership lacks a fundamental misunderstanding of the microprocessor. When it comes to war silicon is the new gasoline.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Do Open: How a Simple Email Newsletter Can Transform Your Business</em>, by David Hieatt</strong>. A really great, fast read on how to make email work. Also a sobering read to if you accept how hard it is to make email work for your business. Essentially if anyone in your organization suggests creating an email newsletter to drive leads throw this book at their head (but, like, nicely).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>EQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence</em>, by Justin Bariso</strong>. EQ is something I struggle with personally, so this was a helpful guide for me on how to think about what actually makes people act the way they do. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Washington: A life</em>, by Ron Chernow</strong>. This might be the best biography I have ever read, both because of how well-written it is (Chernow is super talented) and because of how startling it was to find out that Washington wasn't a great figure in the traditional sense, it was as if he was designed to be fill the exact needs of the founding of our great republic.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Bad Blood</em>, by John Carreyrou</strong>. An engrossing account of this Wall Street Journal reporters take down of a massive fraud. So good. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Where are the Customers' Yachts? Or, A Good Hard Look at Wall Street</em>, by Fred Schwed</strong>. A hilarious account of the perils of professional money management. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>3 Kings: Diddy, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z and Hip-Hop's Multibillion-Dollar Rise</em>, by Zack O'Malley Greenburg</strong>. A really great look at the business of hip hop. Really enjoyable and I didn't expect Diddy to be the most impressive business person of the three.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman</em>, by Yvon Chouinard</strong>. The memoir of the founder of Patagonia. Made me a devotee of the brand.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Blue Magic: The People, Power and Politics Behind the IBM Personal Computer</em>, by James Chposky </strong>. An out-of-print fascinating history of the first successful personal computer, or, how IBM created and lost a huge market. I think anyone in the tech industry would really enjoy this book. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Good Profit: How Creating Value for Others Built One of the World's Most Successful Companies</em>, by Charles Koch</strong>. Say what you will about the politics of the Koch brothers (some is fair, some isn't), but Charles Koch is one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the twentieth century. He has built an amazing business, culture, and track record of success.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Principles</em>, by Ray Dalio</strong>. After reading this book I can't decide if Ray has been successful because of or in spite of his lunatic approach to transparency in business. Still, some terrific wisdom in here.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century</em>, by Walter Scheidel. A wonderful and depressing read on wealth inequality, one that changed my perspective on the topic considerably. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House</em>, by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. The author is by all accounts a fanboy of JFK, so you have to read this with that in mind, but boy is this big, beautiful insider look at the Kennedy administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy</em>, by Stian Westlake, Jonathan Haskel. I love big idea books and this is one of of those. They make a compelling argument that the fundamental nature of the US economy has, for the first time in over 150 years, changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Getting Naked: A Business Fable About Shedding The Three Fears That Sabotage Client Loyalty</em>, by Patrick Lencioni. Another quick business fable style book about consulting. A super interesting read if you work in the services business.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome</em>, by Mary Beard. Makes it an argument for what made Rome, Rome. Not what I expected or was taught in school and pretty damn fascinating. One of my all time favorite books.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are</em>, by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. The rise of search engines, and Google especially, has given us something we have never had: A source of truth about what people actually believe. A very timely read.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy</em>, by Douglas Irwin. I read this comprehensive history of US tariffs because I wanted to understand what they were and what was going to happen with Trump's. Very enjoyable read.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Liar's Poker: Rising through the Wreckage on Wall Street</em>, by Michael Lewis. Another amazing look at greed and excess in 1980s Wall Street. Yes, please.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Limping on Water: My 40-year adventure with one of America's outstanding communications companies</em>, by Philip Beuth. Capital Cities is the greatest company you have never heard of, formerly run by the duo Warren Buffet called probably the best managers of the twentieth century. An insiders account by an early and long time employee.
